This project is an attempt to create a Golden Standard for Web Search Engine Interfaces that is intuitive and usable to the largest number of people. The goal is to convey information without the need for vision. Users who are visually impaired can now spend less time on the Google search result page (SERP), and users with no visual disability can utilize this tool to browse the resutls page without the need to be looking at a screen.

This is done by organizing web search results into a grid and leveraging a person's ability to remember a short list of commands. Once the user remembers 10 (ten) unique, unchanging button commands, they can browse a search engine results page freely.

Follow this link to try out the interface for yourself... [SerpUI Homepage](https://serpui-heroku.herokuapp.com/). If you are not visually impaired and you begin to feel comfortable with the platform try it with your eyes closed! The web app can also be used with a Nintendo JoyCon controller connected via Bluetooth. The inner workings of this application can be found in my thesis, [Development of a Search Engine Tool for Visually Impaired Web Users](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/25138). 

Note: This platform is not complete but serves as a functioning design for how HTML can be rendered differently to produce a more inclusive application. For questions or inquiries about the app or the development process, please reach out!

This interface is developed using NodeJS, powered by Google's Custom Search API. Testing was preformed on Chrome browsers.
